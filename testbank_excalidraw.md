# Testbank Excalidraw Project Summary

## Project Overview

This project transforms the original Excalidraw infinite canvas whiteboard into a page-based note-taking application with specialized touch interactions. The modified version was successfully published to npm under the `@testbank-inc` organization.

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Page-Based Canvas System
- **Adjustable page sizes** with UI controls for custom dimensions
- **Preset page sizes**: A4 (794x1123), Letter (612x792), Square (400x400)
- **Page background and border** rendering
- **Scroll constraints** to keep navigation within page boundaries

### 2. Advanced Touch Interactions
- **Stylus/pen-only drawing**: Finger touches restricted to navigation
- **Pinch zoom functionality** with proper gesture detection
- **One-finger scroll navigation** within canvas bounds
- **Selection-aware touch behavior**: 
  - Selected elements: one-finger touch moves elements
  - No selection: one-finger touch enables scrolling

### 3. Enhanced UI Components
- **Page Settings Dialog** with preset options and custom size inputs
- **Integrated page controls** in the main toolbar
- **Visual page boundaries** with customizable colors and borders

### Key Implementation Files

#### Touch Interaction System (`packages/excalidraw/components/App.tsx`)
- **Pen vs Finger Detection**: Uses `pointerType` and pressure sensitivity
- **Gesture Management**: Multi-touch pinch zoom and single-touch scrolling
- **Selection State Integration**: Context-aware touch behavior

#### Page Management (`packages/excalidraw/scene/scroll.ts`)
- **Boundary Constraints**: `constrainScrollToPageBounds()` function
- **Viewport Calculations**: Dynamic scroll limits based on page and viewport size
- **Centering Logic**: Auto-center when page fits within viewport

#### Canvas Rendering (`packages/excalidraw/renderer/staticScene.ts`)
- **Page Background**: Fills page area with customizable background color
- **Border Rendering**: Optional page border with configurable styling
- **Layer Management**: Page renders below all other elements

### State Management
- **Page Settings**: Stored in `AppState.canvasPageSettings`
- **Default Configuration**: A4 size (794x1123px at 96 DPI)
- **Persistence**: Settings saved to browser storage and export files

## Build System

### Custom Build Scripts
- **`build-packages-sequential.js`**: Builds packages in dependency order
- **`build-packages-js-only.js`**: JavaScript-only builds for faster development
- **`scripts/buildBase.js`**: ESBuild configuration with @testbank-inc aliases

### Development Commands
```bash
yarn test:typecheck     # TypeScript type checking
yarn test:update        # Run all tests with snapshot updates
yarn fix               # Auto-fix formatting and linting
node build-packages-sequential.js  # Build all packages
```

## Published Packages

All packages successfully published to npm under `@testbank-inc` organization:

- **@testbank-inc/excalidraw@0.18.0** - Main React component
- **@testbank-inc/common@0.18.0** - Shared utilities
- **@testbank-inc/math@0.18.0** - Mathematical operations
- **@testbank-inc/element@0.18.0** - Element handling

## Installation and Usage

```bash
npm install @testbank-inc/excalidraw
```

```jsx
import { Excalidraw } from "@testbank-inc/excalidraw";

function App() {
  return (
    <div style={{ height: "100vh" }}>
      <Excalidraw />
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Key Technical Challenges Solved

### 1. Touch Event Conflicts
**Problem**: Two-finger touches triggering hand tool instead of pinch zoom
**Solution**: Early gesture pointer tracking before tool switching logic

### 2. Pinch Zoom Initialization
**Problem**: Pinch zoom not activating reliably
**Solution**: Immediate gesture initialization when second touch detected

### 3. Selection-Aware Scrolling
**Problem**: Touch behavior conflicts between element movement and scrolling
**Solution**: Context-aware touch handling based on selection state

### 4. Scroll Boundary Constraints
**Problem**: Infinite scroll conflicting with page-based design
**Solution**: Dynamic scroll limits calculated from page and viewport dimensions

## Code Quality and Standards

- **TypeScript**: Full type safety with strict configuration
- **React 19**: Modern React patterns and hooks
- **ESLint + Prettier**: Consistent code formatting
- **Monorepo**: Yarn workspaces for dependency management
- **Testing**: Comprehensive test suite with Vitest

## Future Enhancement Opportunities

1. **Multi-page support**: Navigation between multiple pages
2. **Page templates**: Predefined page layouts and styles
3. **Export improvements**: Page-aware export formats
4. **Collaborative editing**: Real-time collaboration within page bounds
5. **Mobile optimization**: Enhanced touch interactions for mobile devices

## Development Notes

- **Gesture Detection**: Uses browser's native `PointerEvent` API
- **Performance**: Optimized rendering with canvas-based approach
- **Accessibility**: Maintains keyboard navigation and screen reader support
- **Cross-platform**: Works on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices

This modified Excalidraw successfully bridges the gap between infinite canvas creativity and structured note-taking, providing a unique drawing experience optimized for touch devices while maintaining the powerful features of the original Excalidraw library.
